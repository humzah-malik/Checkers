## Game Description

Checkers is a classic two-player board game that we‚Äôve reimagined with a modern UI and extra features. Players can compete head-to-head in a 1v1 match or against an AI opponent. The game supports advanced features such as:
- AI with minimax + alpha-beta pruning
- Undo functionality
- Real-time sound effects
- Highlighted legal moves
- Dynamic GUI using Qt Widgets

This project was created as part of the final group assignment for CS3307: Object-Oriented Design and Analysis.
